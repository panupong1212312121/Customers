# üõçÔ∏è Customer Segmentation Workshop: Leveraging K-Prototypes

---

## **Workshop Overview**

This workshop provides a hands-on guide to customer segmentation, focusing on the powerful K-Prototypes clustering algorithm. We'll explore how to handle mixed data types and validate our segmentation results using statistical and visual methods.

## **Key Learning Objectives**

1.  **Handling Mixed Data:** Learn to prepare and analyze datasets that contain both numerical and categorical features for effective clustering using the **K-Prototypes** algorithm.
2.  **Cluster Validation:** Use the **silhouette score** and **silhouette samples** from scikit-learn to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluate the quality of your clustering results.
3.  **Visualization & Statistical Testing:** Visualize your customer segments using `seaborn` and confirm your insights with statistical tests to ensure that the differences between clusters are truly significant.
